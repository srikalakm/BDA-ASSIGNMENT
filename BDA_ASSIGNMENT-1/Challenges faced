1) JRE was not suppporting before as we had installed different versions of java.
 then we later  resolved it through stackover flow .
 
2) Faced errors such HDFS command not found during hadoop installation.

3)  when we run jps command after running start-yarn.sh , we were not able to run Datanode process .
 we resolved it by seeing Hadoop troubleshoot page.

4) " Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: WordCount has been compiled by a more
  recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes 
   class file versions up to 52.0 " 
   
   We were facing the above error later when we tried to run the above program.
   
5) For second input , we had to give 1 million + streaming data but for testing purpose we choose only few of them . 
 The file for the same is: Numbercount.txt
